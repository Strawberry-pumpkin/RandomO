## **Setting Up**<hr>

There are two ways to access the project

1) You can use the files provided in the repository to setup the website
2) Or just visit the [website](https://randomo.pythonanywhere.com/) No setup required :)
<br>
<br>

***It is recommended that you just stick to the website but if you really want to set it up, here's how to do it.***


1) First off, for the Setup to work, you need to have [python](https://www.python.org/) and [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) installed on to your device.

2) Secondly, it'll make everything so easy for you if you use an IDE such as [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/),  [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other IDE of your choice.

3) After that copy the folders [static](https://github.com/Strawberry-pumpkin/RandomO/tree/main/static) and [templates](https://github.com/Strawberry-pumpkin/RandomO/tree/main/templates) to your IDE with all the other files. (If you are using pycharm, you might have to make a new project beforehand)

4) Finally, copy the [app.py](https://github.com/Strawberry-pumpkin/RandomO/blob/main/app.py) to your project/ working directory **Make Sure you keep them out side the 'static' and 'templates' folders**

_keep in mind that the files 'confid.txt','users.txt' and 'contact.txt' files are empty as they get filled upon user actions, but don't worry it won't affect you at all :)_

<br><br>

**Now all you have to do is open the terminal and type  "flask run"**

<br>

PS: You can download all the files in one go by clicking the green color "Code" button and downloading the zip file üòâ (You'll have to extract it before use)
<br>
<br>
